# dummy-repo [rewrite]
This is a diverging branch. I'll preserve this in the clone I'll make.
This isn't really `dummy-repo` anymore, so I'm going to follow [the instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) to disambiguate and sort out my workflow.

## Post-mirror

So I'm now writing on dummy-repo rewrite. A bit of a failure because issues and PRs weren't cloned *nor* were their references preserved.
